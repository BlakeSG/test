            <p class="whoami">who am I? Hello! my name is Blake Gillanders I'm 20 years old and have lived most of my 20 years of life in Nelson New Zealand. 
                First of all, I would like to welcome you to my portfolio it is currently in the early stages of development as I am new coding. I made this 
                website for my first web504 project and its turning out to be a great project for me to learn how to write in html, CSS and JavaScript (coming
                soon). I started building this website about a week into starting my bachelor of IT studies at Nelson Marlborough institute of technology or 
                NMIT for short but before start talking about my studies, I want to give you a backstory on my life and who I am. On august the 29th 2002 I 
                was born in a small town called “Okiwi bay” which has an estimated population of 70 people and is located in the Marlborough sounds I don’t 
                really remember much about it as my family moved to nelson about 6 months later after moving to nelson I went to all the “popular” nelson schools
                my first one being Nelson central school where I had my first experiences with computers mostly playing video games but I knew from then that I
                had a passion for computers. A few years down the road when I was 13 years old, my best mate wanted to build himself his first pc, but he didn’t
                really have any knowledge on how computers worked or how to build them and neither did I so after a ton of research on YouTube he ordered the 
                parts and attempted to build the computer in the end it was functional but had a lot of issues. About a year later and I managed to save up 
                enough money to build my own pc and thankfully with a bit more research and knowledge I was able to build it perfectly. From then my real
                interest in computers appeared I started running a small YouTube channel that at its peak had 10,000 subscribers before I gave up on it the
                most fun part about it was learning how to use programs such as Sony Vegas pro 13 and adobe photoshop cs6 I learned some good skills from 
                that period that I'll never forget but unfortunately as I got older and left school I had less time for computers as I had my first full time
                job working in a factory while I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. About a year later I met my fiancé Pallas (on the left side of 
                the picture at top of the page) after a few months of dating we found our own place and moved in together and I made a decision to sell my
                entire setup as I didn’t use it much at the time but just 6 months later, I regretted it. After moving in with Pallas I explored a lot of
                career options like engineering I did 6 months as an engineer's assistant where I learned how to fabricate and weld which was really 
                interesting but wasn’t quite for me from there, I went to a different company called “van and a man” where I was planning on getting my class 2
                license but after a few disagreements with the boss I returned to my previous job and decided to look at my study options where I came across
                the “bachelor of IT” course and after reading up about it seemed really interesting so I decided to apply and before I even got accepted I 
                bought a decently powerful laptop and started playing around with websites such as “free code camp” and “code academy” shortly after that I got
                accepted into NMIT and that pretty much leads back to now where I'm learning to code while designing this website. So, on this website you can
                find 4 pages the home page which is the page you’re currently on next up is the “myskills” page which has a bullet point list which showcases
                all my skills related to study and qualifications I have from work it also has an attached copy of my cv. Next page is the projects page which
                is where I am going to be uploading all my projects from study or personal projects, I have completed all projects will be downloadable HTML
                or PDF files and are located in different sections depending on what class they were made for. Finally, there's the contact page which has all
                my contact methods email addresses, social media and a contact form so if you have any questions for me don’t hesitate to get in contact. Well,
                that’s all I have to say so I hope you enjoy my website and thanks for visiting
