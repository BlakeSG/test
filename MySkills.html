        <h1>Skills page!</h1>
        <p>On this page you will find a list of all my current skills a copy of my current cv and all my new skills that im currently working on improving.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>First of all Id like to include a link of my current Cv which includes all my current work experiance and qualifications iswell as a big selection
                    of refernces who can confirm my claims.</p><a href="Blake-Gillanders-CV.pdf">My CV</a> </li>
                <li><p>The first skill Id like to list is my "tech savvy skills" Ive been using computers from a young age so I have accrued a number of technical skillls
                    that most people lack for example I can build a functional pc and easily install an os, setup a static IP, Im very quick to learn new programs and have knowledge
                    on alot of the basic programs that are used within the industry and I can generally diagnose and fix most problems on a pc wether its hardware related or software
                    relate.</p></li>
                <li><p>Im currently learning both HTML and css and have a pretty basic understanding on how it works but im learning new functions everyday and enjoying putting hours
                    into creating this portfolio which isnt currently anything too flash but is functional and I will continue to refine the portfolio and my skills even after the assignment is submitted</p></li>
                <li><p>another useful computer skill I have is my editting skills I have done some work on both photoshop cs6 and vegas pro 14 for mostly fun but also ran a small business online
                    editting videos and creating thumbnails for small content creators.</p></li> 
                <li><p>I also have alot of other skills that dont relate to IT such as I have my forklift OSH certificate and over 1 year of experiance driving one also have my class 2 learner truck license
                    with experiance driving a class two truck. These skills dont really relate to what im studying but thought they were worth mentioning as its something that I put some time into and really enjoyed
                    learning.
                <li><p>I also have over two years work experiance working various different jobs since leaving school none of them relate to what I want to do with my life but they did teach me alot of 
                    valuable things such as, work ethic, time management, persiverence and how to work in a team which I beleive will be very useful for both this course and any future work I do in this industry
                </p></li>
