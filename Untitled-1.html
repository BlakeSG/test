            <p class="whoami">who am I?..., Hello!, my name is Blake Gillanders Im 20 years old and I have lived all 20 years of my life in Nelson New Zealand. In those 20 years I have developped alot of skills and interests and learned alot about myself.
                When I was 12 years old my mother gave me my first laptop and I was instantly hooked I mostly used it for home work and gaming nothing too exciting but as time passed the laptop slowed down and became quite out dated so I wanted 
                something better but couldnt afford to buy a prebuilt pc so I decided to save up and build a pc myself it took me about a year to save all the money I needed but was well worth it and finally built my first pc which really sparked my
                interest for computers I started learning new skills such as photoshop mostly making thumbnails and random images for fun sony vegas pro for video editting and blender for some 3d rendering I applied all these skills and ran a small youtube
                channel that had around 10,000 subscribers at the time of me quitting and started a small online business editting videos and creating thumbnails for other content creators
                I ran this through discord mostly for friends and friends of friends but was a nice little income stream when I was a teenager. I stopped doing video editting and creation when I left school at 18 years old When I left I had my NCEA level 2
                and had absolutely no clue about what I was going to do with my life so I got a job working in mussel processing factory called "MacLab LTD" it was kind of fun at first I got to work a whole range of different jobs there inside the factory, outside the factory
                did a few months working as the engineers assisstent where I learnt to weld(tig and arc) and some basic fabrication skills and made some good friends. While I was working for MacLab I moved out of home at 19
                and moved in with my new girlfriend who I had only known for 1 month at the time but it somehow actually worked out great two years later were still living together, recently engaged and saving to buy our first house. The only problem
                with the plan of buying a new house is that I wasnt earning much money from maclab and the job was really starting affect me so we got talking and decided to make a change so with the support of my fiance I enrolled into NMIT to do my Bachelors of "IT"degree
                I was also lucky enough to a casual contract at maclab where I generally work 3-5 hours monday to friday before study begins and I also work sundays delivering "my foodbag"and"bargain boxs" for nz post. Ive been with nmit for around a month now
                and im finding it to be the most interesting experiance of my life im starting to gain more skills and discover my passions and Ive even got a favourite class which is networking and at this stage I think it would be a really interesting field 
                to work in.
